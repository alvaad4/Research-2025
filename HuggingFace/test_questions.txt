# --- Text Summarization ---
Question: Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence: "The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century revolutionized the spread of information.

Question: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the following excerpt: "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas) which produces heat-trapping gases. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to human health and food security."

With courage and a pure heart, she touched the crystal, absorbing its darkness and transforming it into light, healing the woods and saving her people."
Question: Summarize the key argument made in the following research abstract: "This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for image recognition that significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy.

These results suggest a promising direction for deploying complex vision models on resource-constrained devices."
Question: Provide a headline-style summary (less than 10 words) of the following event: "A powerful earthquake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, struck the coast of Japan early Tuesday morning, triggering tsunami warnings and causing widespread damage to infrastructure and buildings.

Question: Summarize the main characteristics of a "black hole" based on the text below: "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation like light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although it obstructs the passage of light, its presence can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and electromagnetic radiation, such as the disruption of nearby stars and active galactic nuclei."
